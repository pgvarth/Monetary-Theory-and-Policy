# Monetary Theory and Policy (4th year)

*Pre-requisites: Mathematics, Macroeconomic Theory II

# Content: 

This course equips students with the essential analytical, technical, and quantitative skills to understand and apply modern macroeconomic analysis with a strong focus on both monetary and fiscal policy.  The course combines the analysis of macroeconomic data with the development of modern micro-founded general equilibrium macroeconomic models. Students will learn how to use and interpret these theoretical models to study current economic policy issues as well as to process and interpret economic data for economic policy analysis. Ultimately, students will acquire necessary skills and competences so as to pursuit a professional career as applied economists to policy-orientated institutions.  Particular emphasis would be put on using quantitative methods to analyze macroeconomic data as well as solve macroeconomic models in Matlab and/or Python which are widely used in Central Banks and other policy institutes. 

$\textbf{Software:}$ Matlab (mostly), Python
