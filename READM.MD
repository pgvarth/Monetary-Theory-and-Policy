# Content: 

This undergraduate course in macroeconomics aims to provide students with the necessary analytical, technical, and quantitative tools to understand modern macroeconomic analysis. 
We will combine the analysis of macroeconomic data with the development of key theoretical simple macroeconomic models, from the traditional IS-LM analysis to modern micro-founded general equilibrium models. 
These tools will be used to interpret the behavior of aggregate macroeconomic variables. Students will learn how to use and interpret modern theoretical models to study current economic policy issues as well as to process and interpret economic data for policy analysis. 
Ultimately, students will acquire necessary skills and competences so as to pursuit a professional career as applied economists to policy-orientated institutions.  Particular emphasis would be put on using quantitative methods to analyze macroeconomic data as well as solve simple macroeconomic models in Matlab and/or Python. 

$\textbf{Software:}$ Matlab, Python
